## üéØ About

**ValTimer** is an intelligent overlay application that automatically detects when the Spike is planted in Valorant and displays a precise 45-second countdown timer. Built with computer vision (OpenCV), it uses template matching to detect the Spike UI element on your screen.

Perfect for:
- üéÆ Competitive players who need precise timing
- üìä Players learning Spike timings and rotations
- üèÜ Teams coordinating defuse/retake strategies

---

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç **Automatic Detection**
- Real-time Spike plant detection using OpenCV template matching
- No game modifications or memory reading required
- Works entirely through screen capture (safe & undetectable)

### ‚è∞ **Precise Countdown**
- 45-second countdown overlay appears automatically
- Large, visible timer on your screen
- 50-second cooldown between detections to prevent false triggers

### üñ•Ô∏è **Multi-Resolution Support**
- **1920x1080** (Full HD)
- **2560x1440** (2K/1440p)
- **1440x1080** (4:3 stretched)
- Optimized ROI (Region of Interest) for each resolution

### üé® **Valorant-Themed UI**
- Modern card-style interface with Valorant color scheme
- Clean, intuitive controls
- System tray integration (minimize to tray)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Spike Mechanics Reference**
- Built-in popup with accurate Valorant Spike timings
- Plant times, defuse times, audio cues
- Half-defuse checkpoint information

### üîß **Additional Features**
- Debug mode for ROI visualization
- Tooltip hints for all buttons
- Lightweight and runs in the background

## üì• Installation

### Option 1: Download Executable (Recommended)

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/trtrantnt/ValTimerv1.2/releases)
2. Download the latest `ValTimer.exe`
3. Run the executable (no installation needed!)

### Option 2: Run from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/trtrantnt/ValTimerv1.2.git
cd ValTimerv1.2

# Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python numpy mss pillow pystray

# Run the application
python timer_valo.py
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Launch ValTimer.exe**
2. **Select your resolution** (1920x1080, 2560x1440, or 1440x1080)
3. **Click "Start Detection"**
4. **Play Valorant!**
   - Timer will automatically appear when Spike is planted
   - Timer shows exact countdown from 45 seconds

### Controls

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1920x1080** | Select Full HD resolution |
| **2560x1440** | Select 2K/1440p resolution |
| **1440x1080** | Select 4:3 stretched resolution |
| **Start Detection** | Begin monitoring for Spike plant |
| **Stop** | Stop detection and hide timer |
| **‚ÑπÔ∏è Info** | View Spike mechanics and timings |

### System Tray

- **Minimize**: Click ‚ùå to minimize to system tray
- **Show Window**: Right-click tray icon ‚Üí Show
- **Exit**: Right-click tray icon ‚Üí Exit

### Finding ROI for Custom Resolution

If your resolution is not supported, use `find_spike_position.py` to find the correct ROI:

```bash
# 1. Run the ROI finder tool
python find_spike_position.py

# 2. Go to Valorant and plant the Spike
# 3. Alt+Tab back and press Enter to capture screen
# 4. Draw a rectangle around the Spike icon
# 5. Press 's' to save ROI coordinates

# 6. Copy the output to timer_valo.py RESOLUTION_SETTINGS
```

The tool will generate:
- ‚úÖ ROI coordinates in Python format
- ‚úÖ JSON file with ROI data
- ‚úÖ Screenshot and ROI region image

## üî® Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- pip package manager

### Build Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/trtrantnt/ValTimerv1.2.git
cd ValTimerv1.2

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python numpy mss pillow pystray pyinstaller

# 3. Build executable
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --name "ValTimer" timer_valo.py

# 4. Find executable in dist/ folder
cd dist
```

### Custom Icon (Optional)

```bash
# Generate custom icon
python app_icon.py

# See CUSTOM_ICON.md for detailed instructions
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Python 3.13** - Core programming language
- **OpenCV (cv2)** - Computer vision and template matching
- **NumPy** - Numerical operations for image processing
- **MSS** - Fast screen capture
- **Tkinter** - GUI framework
- **Pillow (PIL)** - Image handling
- **pystray** - System tray integration
- **PyInstaller** - Executable packaging

### Detection Algorithm

1. **Screen Capture**: Captures ROI using MSS (ultra-fast)
2. **Edge Detection**: Applies Canny edge detection (thresholds: 100, 200)
3. **Template Matching**: Uses `TM_CCOEFF_NORMED` method
4. **Threshold**: Match confidence > 0.15 triggers countdown
5. **Cooldown**: 50-second cooldown prevents duplicate detections

## ‚ùì FAQ

### **Q: Is this safe to use? Will I get banned?**
A: ValTimer only uses screen capture - it doesn't modify game files or read game memory. It's completely external and undetectable.

### **Q: Why isn't detection working?**
A: Make sure you've selected the correct resolution matching your Valorant display settings.

### **Q: Can I use this on other resolutions?**
A: Currently only 1080p, 1440p, and 4:3 (1440x1080) are supported. Submit an issue to request your resolution!

### **Q: Does this work with Vanguard anti-cheat?**
A: Yes! ValTimer runs completely outside the game and doesn't interact with Valorant's process.

### **Q: The timer appears at wrong times**
A: Try adjusting detection threshold or ensure proper resolution is selected. Debug mode can help visualize ROI.

### **Q: How do I enable debug mode?**
A: Open `timer_valo.py`, change `DEBUG_MODE = False` to `DEBUG_MODE = True`, and rebuild.
